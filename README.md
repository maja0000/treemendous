# Hey Ecosia team! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¥¦

Thank you for the challenge, it was fun to design and implement!

Let's get you set up

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the development server
npm run dev

# open a browser of your choice
http://localhost:3000

# run tests
npm test

```

A list of follow-up tasks:
1. Add more user-friendly UI design -> optimistic UI for cards, loading indicator for individual pictures etc.
I haven't included them, as you requested no use of an external library and DIYing would be unnecessary in my opinion. 
2. Centralise styles to be reused throughout the library (define colors and all styles in one place, maybe extend styling library theme)



A quick UI design ðŸŽ¨
